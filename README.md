# Decimal-to-Binary-Hex-Calculator
#C++

This project is a simple calculator that uses a stack to convert a base 10 number into either base 2 or 16. For this assignment, we had to create our own stack class rather than use the one in the standard library. 

My professor, Kazumi Slott, provided the checkInput.h file to check whether the user entered a number within the appropriate range.
